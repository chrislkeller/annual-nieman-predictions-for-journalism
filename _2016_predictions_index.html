<h1>Nieman Lab Predictions for Journalism 2016</h1><h4>The battle to stand out</h4><h5>By Nathalie Malinarich</h5><h6><a href='http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/the-battle-to-stand-out/'>Originally published on Nieman Lab</a></h6><div class="simple-body" style="font-family: freight-sans-pro, georgia, serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 30px; width: 100%; padding: 0 25px 25px 25px; margin: 0;">
<div id="content_div-118966">
<p><strong>The battle to stand out</strong>: Everyone enjoys seeing a video about a cat, an uplifting human story or a breathtaking #fail in their Facebook feed, right? But do you still enjoy it when the same clip pops up over and over and over again?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I'm probably the first one in the newsroom demanding speedy publication of those charming cats. But if every news outlet uses the same footage, presented in the same way, with the now obligatory text on screen, how is anyone going win the battle for people's attention?</p>
<p>Hopefully media organizations will work out their strengths and break from the pack to succeed. Chasing clicks, taps, and views with the same content is a short-term game.</p>
<p><strong>Animate it!</strong>: The appetite for mobile/social video will continue to grow&#8230;and maybe brevity will finally win out. Let's explain the world with short animated graphics or even GIFs. Snapchat has unleashed incredible creative forces with Discover and Stories. This short-form storytelling is bound to catch on beyond the world of chat apps. To quote Cory Bergman of Breaking News, <a href="http://mobilemediamemo.com/the-videofication-of-everything/">"it's the videofication of everything."</a></p>
<p><strong>No flipping</strong>: Stop making people tilt their heads or twist their phones. 16:9 is not the only aspect ratio in town and we'll see more "traditional" broadcasters experiment with vertical video.</p>
<p><strong>Look around you</strong>: The New York Times wowed us with its <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/nyt-vr-how-to-experience-a-new-form-of-storytelling-from-the-times.html?_r=1">high-end VR stories</a>. Others, including the BBC, have given reporters 360º cameras to experiment in the field. In 2016, you'll see more VR videos as they become easier to film and publish to a range of platforms. Yes, that person on the train waving their phone around is just trying to get the full VR experience.</p>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong>: As a rather indiscriminate subscriber to notifications, I'm hoping they'll become smarter in 2016 - more personalised and contextual. Or maybe I just need to switch them off.</p>
<p><strong>Atomic</strong>: The Circa app we knew and loved no longer exists, but its promise of atomized news is by no means dead. Expect to see more from the labs of <a href="http://nytlabs.com/blog/2015/10/20/particles/">The New York Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-09-elastic-news-on-a-mobile">BBC</a> and others on this front. (And don't forget to count how many articles report the death of the article.)</p>
<p><strong>XX</strong>: More big media organizations will wake up to the fact that half the world has two X chromosomes, and they'll offer a more representative news agenda as a result of this revelation.</p>
<p>Oh, and we'll see even more amazing women in digital. I'm sure.</p>

<div id="content_div-118949">
<p>A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a rather intense meeting at work. My Apple Watch tapped me on the wrist and, as I usually do when I receive a notification, I checked to make sure everything was okay with my daughter and the world wasn't collapsing into further chaos. </p>
<p>The notification had come from NYT Cooking via Facebook's new app, Notify. It said, "You're going to need - and eat - a lot of these, tender homemade biscuits next week."</p>
<p>I was somewhat amused, somewhat annoyed. But most of all, it was abundantly clear to me that we have a long way to go before notifications feel like they know me. </p>
<p>I love everything that NYT Cooking produces. I love their notifications. I even love making biscuits. But I don't need to be bothered by biscuits in the middle of the workday. Facebook knows that I'm employed and that I live on the East Coast of the U.S., so it's not a huge stretch for the app to assume I'm at work at 4:52 p.m., and to know that an alert about something other than breaking news can wait until later. </p>
<p>We're not at the point yet, though, where most notifications use our location, our schedule, our reading habits, and our friends to present themselves in smarter ways. I predict that 2016 will be a year where we see breakthroughs on this front. </p>
<p>As news and other forms of content are broken down into smaller and smaller atomic units, <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/the-end-of-apps-as-we-know-them/">separated from the apps or publishers that produce them</a>, it becomes more and more important that the notification layer becomes smarter. Expecting people to spend time editing preferences for what they want and don't want is very Web 1.0. News organizations know what we read, so those reading habits should be taken into account when their apps decide to push us something.</p>
<p>This becomes even more important with the rise of wearables, even though, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/wearable-tech-creeps-into-the-mainstream/">despite predictions to the contrary right here</a>, they still haven't broken through to the mainstream or proven their necessity yet. As anyone with an Apple Watch will tell you, though, it's all about the notifications, not the apps. The taps on my wrist make it abundantly clear just how dumb most notifications are. </p>
<p>As Paul Adams, vice president of product at Intercom, wrote recently, <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/its-time-for-notifications-to-get-smart/">"Despite all of the advances of the past 20 years, notifications are still stuck in 1999."</a></p>
<p>But there are some developments that should help spur advances. For example, notifications are starting to become a standalone destination where you go for information, just as search and social stand on their own. I've been waiting for the Notification Center on my iPhone to stop feeling like wasted space. It has finally begun to happen for me with Slack and Facebook Notify. I now find myself going to the Notifications Center to catch up on what I've missed. It's quicker and less noisy than checking the news on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<p>Michael Cerda, product director at Facebook, has said that <a href="http://recode.net/2015/11/11/facebooks-new-app-notify-pushes-content-to-your-lock-screen/">Facebook views notifications as their own medium</a>, separate from other news consumption platforms. If Facebook thinks the notifications medium is still evolving and worth focusing on, then one can assume we'll see big improvements from them, given their vast array of data and engineering talent. </p>
<p>From personal experience, I know it's easy to say notifications should be smarter, but it's decidedly not easy to make that happen. At Meetup, we have a team building a member-centric notification system to ensure that members aren't bombarded with notifications, as we've been known to do with email. We want to make sure we're sending notifications at the specific time when they're most useful, like right before or right after a Meetup. Our system scores each notification and will take into account how a member has engaged with notifications in the past, allowing us to determine the contents and timing of the next one we send. Perhaps most importantly, this system will increase the chances you won't want to hurl your phone across the room because you feel interrupted or spammed. </p>
<p>Our product managers and engineers will tell you these are hard, complicated problems to solve. </p>
<p>The potential is huge, though, and we're redesigning the Meetup apps with the notification experience at the center, not as an afterthought. Given the serious boost in traffic that news organizations see from push notifications, I would hope they are doing the same. Just sending more notifications isn't going to cut it. They have to get smart.</p>

<div id="content_div-118943">
<p>Some media analysts see a bubble poised to burst; others, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/technology/personaltech/podcasting-blossoms-but-in-slow-motion.html">incremental growth</a>. I see something more radical: a complete regime change in the audio landscape. Finally. </p>
<p>Right now, radio dominates - terrestrial radio occupies 52 percent of all audio consumption; satellite, another 8 percent. And in total, those two comprise 74 percent of all audio revenue. (Music streaming and downloads nab most of the rest.) </p>
<p>Yet they suck. They suck as user experiences; they suck as content sources. </p>
<p>Satellite radio sucks the most. It's a stultifying interface, most of the content is terrible, and it <em>costs you money</em>. It's the worst format that you have to <em>pay</em> for. (SiriusXM inexplicably pulls down $4.2 billion per year in revenue.) If ever there were an industry ready for disruption&#8230;</p>
<p>But before jumping off the prediction cliff, let's acknowledge the obvious: Foretelling the rise of podcasting is a tale as old as Odin, or at least <a href="http://evhead.com/2005/02/how-odeo-happened.asp">Odeo</a>. And after years of hopeful hypothesizing, podcasting still only captures 2 percent of all audio consumption. But three factors - all relatively new - will push podcasting into the mainstream:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better experience.</strong> One of the few good things about radio is that when you get into a car, "it just works." But now that mobile phones seamlessly connect to Bluetooth-enabled cars without any fuss, radio's advantage is diminished. Also, a spate of podcasting apps have given consumers diverse playback options, which in turn pushes further innovation and best practices in user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Better content.</strong> As Serial accrued 2.2 million downloads per episode at the end of last year, "What's your favorite podcast?" became a popular conversational gambit, which propelled networks like Gimlet and Panoply to create even more quality shows. Almost overnight, the biggest complaint about podcasting has become that there are <em>too many</em> good shows to follow.</li>
<li><strong>Better revenue.</strong> Even medium-sized podcasts can now command a $20-$50 CPM for a 60-second spot. (Radio grabs less than $2-$10 CPM.) Among the many reasons for this: quality of the content, desirability of the audience, and intimacy of the ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Podcasting is now poised to finally gobble up that aging radio audience. With superior programming delivered in a better experience at less cost, there's no reason that podcasting can't overtake satellite radio. This will happen surprisingly fast. </p>
<p>But going a little further out on a limb, here are some specific sub-predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HBO will use Bill Simmons to build a new media network.</strong> Most of Grantland's revenue derived from a podcasting network, which is slowly being <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast">reconstituted</a> at HBO. One of the biggest mysteries in media right now is what shape his new HBO website will take. I expect something that looks less like the text-rich Grantland and more like a media-centric platform.</li>
<li><strong>Serial will break new records.</strong> With the help of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/us/bowe-bergdahl-to-face-court-martial-on-desertion-charges.html">real-time breaking news</a>, the audience for the new Serial will be even bigger than the first season.</li>
<li><strong>Gimlet Media will launch a fusillade of shows.</strong> A couple will fail, but this is a hits business, and by the end of the year, the network will dominate the <a href="http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/podcasts/">iTunes charts</a>. Within two years, the company will have a $100 million valuation.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue opportunities will increase.</strong> Right now, Mailchimp and Squarespace are like the DraftKings and FanDuel of podcasting - suspiciously pervasive. But high-end brands are banging on doors to sponsor high-quality podcasts. Because the demand is still high, the Super Bowl-level CPMs will not shrink, but a more diverse crop of advertisers will emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Howard Stern will join the "loser" revolution.</strong> Many <a href="http://calacanis.com/2015/07/27/howard-sterns-easy-billion-dollar-pay-day-courtesy-of-spotify-or-an-app/">pundits</a> predicted, inaccurately, that Howard Stern would not renew his SiriusXM contract, hoping that he would instead move to Spotify, Netflix, or Apple Music. (Another sign of the antipathy toward satellite radio: This prediction was more of a wish-fulfilling mass projection than actual soothsaying.) But this didn't happen - or did it? If you haven't noticed, the Howard Stern Show has quietly drifted onto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HOWARDTV">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/howardstern">Soundcloud</a> in an official capacity after years of quasi-illicit accounts. (I say "quasi" because they looked suspiciously like in-house creations with obfuscated usernames.) "Podcasts," Howard Stern <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHdwbN_pKQw">said</a> earlier this year, invoking his old shock jock persona, "are for losers." But this is classic Stern subterfuge - his show has already become a podcast.</li>
<li><strong>Podcasting will die, but thrive.</strong> It's true, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/podcasting-in-2015-feels-a-lot-like-blogging-circa-2004-exciting-evolving-and-trouble-for-incumbents/">podcasting in 2015 is like blogging in 2004</a>. And blogging didn't die - it became pervasive. Podcasting will endure a similar evolution, with so much adaption that "podcasting" will erode as a term while the form becomes ubiquitous. Already, the traditional silos of a media industry are taking shape, with new companies appearing to handle analytics, distribution, production, and advertising. Expect more "studios" and "networks" to emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Content sources will multiply and surprise.</strong> In a year of highlights that included <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama">Marc Maron interviewing Barack Obama</a> in his garage, something called the "GE Podcast Theater" producing the surprise hit <a href="http://themessagepodcast.com/">The Message</a>, and a venture capital firm producing <a href="http://a16z.com/tag/podcasts/">one of the best tech podcasts</a> of the year, we can expect to see more programming derived from unforeseen places. Media companies will continue adapting their franchises to podcasts, agencies will empower brands to create new shows, podcasting networks will devise new aural experiments, and even more independents will pop up from unexpected places.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be a good year to listen. </p>

<div id="content_div-118936">
<p>The digital arena has been deeply confusing for both advertisers and publishers. At first, we thought it was just like print - so we ripped out static ads from print publications and pasted them on people's screens as banner ads. Then we decided that it was just like TV, so we made people watch commercials (or pieces of them) before we could see the content - just like a TV timeout at a football game.</p>
<p>It turns out that the public didn't react much to either, because the digital realm isn't like other places that advertisers were used to. It is much more dynamic than print and much more intimate than TV. People get to direct and customize much of their digital experience - looking at what they want to look at, when they want to look at it, and with whom they want to look at it. In that same vein, it has proven hard to <em>make</em> people look at digital ads. You have to get them to <em>want</em> to look at them.</p>
<p>The good news is that the advertising industry is experimenting like crazy and slowly coming up with more ads that people want to look at all the time.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/purinapuppychow/puppyhood-910i#.ui4wbbaxA">"Puppyhood" ads</a> for Purina on BuzzFeed? It's impossible not to watch them. How about the eBay ads on <a href="http://imgur.com/user/eBay">imgur</a>? They're very popular with imgur users, even though they know they're ads. And these are just two examples of the thousands of new ways that advertisers are figuring out how the digital space is fundamentally different - but certainly no less interesting - than more traditional media. I fully expect that by the end of 2016 we will see many more advertisers and news organizations coming out and saying: "We finally have digital ads that are driving big revenue!"</p>
<p>But it won't all be about a digital future. I also predict that there will be a new and growing appreciation for the power and value of print advertising. <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/wpp-ceo-martin-sorrell-lends-support-print-media/297807/">Sir Martin Sorrell</a> says it's true. The simple fact is that no matter how cool the digital realm is, print is still an awesome technology that does something almost magical in our high-speed world: It keeps people engaged. Print is again going to attract advertisers who are willing to say: "I don't care about being cool. I want to drive big sales at a good price."</p>

<div id="content_div-118932">
<p>Remember when all we wanted to know was how a story "did"?</p>
<p>"Doing well" used to be easy to figure out - it was just about the clicks - but in recent years we've all been trying to figure out how to define success better, to get away from the allegedly empty calories of mere traffic and integrate other metrics into the equation (while secretly thinking that nothing still feels quite as good as the guilty pleasure of pageviews).</p>
<p>But 2016 will be the year that we will shift the focus. It will be the year that we begin to understand what success really looks like, and realize that it takes as many different forms as there are different audiences on different platforms.</p>
<p>2016 will be the year that success will be defined not only by the quality of the journalism and its distribution and reach, but by the many other storytelling features that create satisfaction and commitment in a reader: Was it the right story for that particular audience, on that platform, in that format, at that time? A story that is successful will be less defined by how it "does" than by the effect it has - by its impact on audiences.</p>
<p>Success will be less about a result than a relationship.</p>
<p>Metrics will begin to get away from the page and into the heads of our audience. We will go beyond pageviews and engaged time - which was very popular in 2015! - and we'll begin to measure the effect that the actual storytelling has on users. How did that topic, or the use of video at the top of a story, or embedding a chart or a graphic, or this particular length, or the option to comment, or placing share buttons, or offering a follow function, or sending a push notification - how did each of these editorial choices affect your audience? How did it make them behave?</p>
<p>We'll still be analyzing the story, but we'll also be analyzing the audience. We still want to know how the story does, but we'll also be very curious about what audiences do - and what that behavior tells us about them.</p>
<p>Have they behaved in ways that we think are signs of satisfaction or pleasure or contentment or surprise? Did they scroll to the bottom, click on the animated explainer, follow the topic, tweet a pull quote, click on a related story, sign up for an alert, comment? The way audiences act on a website won't be the same way they behave on a social media platform, in Apple News, or on a chat app. So 2016 will also be the year of bespoke distribution, when we begin to treat every platform like a publishing platform, with its unique audience, its own publishing schedule and formats, and its unique metrics of success.</p>
<p>Because no matter where audiences are and how they behave when they're there, we'll be trying to produce journalism that will make them act in ways that prove to us they find our content good enough to come back for more, more frequently, and consume more. That tell us they are satisfied, fulfilled, intrigued - even seduced! - enough to stick with the relationship.</p>
<p>It turns out that success in the age of disruptive digital media may actually be a pretty traditional thing: It's about getting hitched. No one, of course, has the secret to successful lasting relationships. But we'll be working on it.</p>

<div id="content_div-118842">
<p>2016 is shaping up as the year when the "distributed content" wave overcomes traditional web platforms. It seems like the right time to ask: What will be the impact of distributed content on the digital distribution of local journalism?</p>
<p>This may be more of an aspiration than a prediction, but it is my hope that in 2016 the great technology companies of our time will give more prominence to stories that matter to their users closer to home.</p>
<p>Currently, local reporting appears to be an afterthought on these social platforms. On a random Monday afternoon in December, as I sat at my desk in Boston, scanning my social media outlets, only three percent of the stories that appeared on Facebook and Twitter's curated Trending and Moments feeds qualified as local news. And when I clicked on one of the few local trending stories that did appear, I was served with an article published by Fox News instead of one sourced from the local entity that originally broke the story and which likely had better sourcing on the ground.</p>
<p>I don't think these choices are ill-intentioned. Private companies have every right to focus on where they can gain the highest profits, and getting their news feeds to achieve local scale is an immense and expensive challenge. </p>
<p>But make no mistake - these are <em>choices</em>. By choosing to prioritize stories of national interest, these platforms are going to accelerate the decline of local journalism. In 2016, we should all be aware of the unintended consequences of that choice. </p>
<p>As social media and peer-to-peer chat apps become omnipresent, "reach" becomes the most important metric for news organizations fighting for relevancy. When technology companies don't make a concerted effort to surface local news in their algorithms and curated feeds, local news outlets who <em>do</em> choose to cover important local or regional issues lose the ability to reach potential audiences - and lose out on the sharing those audiences would have done, compounding the network effect.</p>
<p>Instead, the only way for these local outlets to compete for attention among the #trending is to assign reporters to cover general-interest national news. That's why you see unlikely news sources writing hot takes on the latest Will Ferrell Saturday Night Live skit - because it's the only way for them to appear on the trending feed of your favorite social media platform. This becomes a self-fulfilling race to the bottom that further erodes the visibility, quality, and relevancy of local journalism. </p>
<p>What about the publishers currently listed as media partners for Facebook's Instant Articles? Other than Philadelphia news startup Billy Penn and Gannett, so far, local or regional publications have been shut out of the experiment. Facebook says it hopes to roll Instant Articles out to all publishers and that the reason they haven't yet is because they're in a beta testing phase. Let's hope so.</p>
<p>Then there's Snapchat's popular Discover platform where all 18 publishers listed are national entities. Apple News and Google AMP seem promising but both platforms require already small product teams to build out feeds using limited development resources. </p>
<p>I'm lucky enough to work at a regional publication which holds the dominant footprint in New England and a wide national audience, and so, even though we haven't yet been fully embraced by these social platforms, we know that we'll be in the conversation when their efforts are rolled out further. But what about smaller city and regional publications? How will they compete in a world where 97 percent of the curated news on a random day is not local? Most importantly, what will be the impact on citizens who, instead of wading through a partisan filter bubble, will instead have to filter through a national/local bubble? Imagine how different our world would have been if there was no local news on television.</p>
<p>Here's one prediction that I can almost guarantee: In 2016, local investigative journalism will be front and center on the Hollywood red carpet with accolades pouring in for the movie <em>Spotlight</em>, a film written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, based on the local investigative reporting published by my colleagues in 2002. Let's not celebrate that film as an ode to what used to be in our craft. Rather, let's use it as a clarion call for the importance of local journalism in the Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter era. In the distributed content ecosystem, we need our hyper-relevant news feeds to include hyper-local news sources, as well.</p>

Tofel</h5><h6><a href='http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/the-press-grapples-with-demagoguery/'>Originally published on Nieman Lab</a></h6><div class="simple-body" style="font-family: freight-sans-pro, georgia, serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 30px; width: 100%; padding: 0 25px 25px 25px; margin: 0;">
<div id="content_div-118914">
<p>The last time a demagogue got so far in American politics - Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s - the press ended up hating itself the morning after. This time, the cycle of self-loathing, like everything else, is likely to come thicker and faster, and to importantly shape coverage of the 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>McCarthy's rise, it was clear on reflection, would not have been possible without the press corps, even though most of them actually largely despised him from the first. McCarthy overcame their disdain because he saw flaws in the structure of press coverage itself and ruthlessly exploited them. The flaws were, first, that every story was presumed to have two sides, and that duly reporting both sides was sufficient; and second, that official statements by important people like United States senators needed, at least initially, to be transmitted to readers without much analysis or any comment.</p>
<p>The reality, of course, was that a baseless accusation of treason against an individual (some famous, many not) and a denial of that treason do not perforce combine into a fair story. And repeating new accusations by a public official with a track record of reckless falsehood serves no purpose except the demagogue's own. When Edward R. Murrow concluded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUMEq24tqtU">his historic denunciation of McCarthy</a> - 49 months after the reign of terror had begun - by quoting Cassius from Shakespeare's <em>Julius Caesar</em> in saying, "the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves," he was referring to everyone in his audience. But the press ended up taking the message personally.</p>
<p>The adversarial press that flourished especially after Vietnam and Watergate was fueled by those debacles, to be sure, but also had the reaction against McCarthyism as a key underpinning.</p>
<p>And, yet, here we are again, 60 years after McCarthy's fall. At the larger level, the lesson is the same: Donald Trump has read the media landscape more carefully than the media, and spewed racist venom and blatant falsehoods in a manner that has proven politically effective in the short run.</p>
<p>The self-correction of the press seems to be coming more quickly this time around, clocking in at about five months instead of nearly 50. Tom Brokaw is not the Edward R. Murrow of today, but he is probably the closest thing we've got. And he's <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/tom-brokaw-reflects-on-trump-s--dangerous-proposal--to-ban-muslims-582434371851">just as angry now</a> as Murrow was then. What difference will it make?</p>
<p>Coverage of the 2016 campaign from here is likely to be even more skeptical than in recent years. Fact-checking is getting quicker, moving higher in stories, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/fact-check.html#/factcheck-15">becoming more mobile-friendly</a>. Candidate claims may actually be challenged at the very same time they are published. When made by those not already well positioned in the polls (as Trump was not when he lied about Mexicans in June), it now seems possible to imagine false claims actually ending up not being published at all. Surely it has become clear that publishing and then fact-checking is not enough.</p>
<p>Most important of all would be if the former gatekeepers in the press girded their coverage to resume a bit of gatekeeping. If the issue of the day is how to counter ISIS, perhaps we won't get as readily distracted by a proposal to establish concentration camps or suspend the Constitution or whatever it would take to shock us next. Maybe we could stamp our collective feet and insist on hearing just how a candidate proposes to do stop ISIS, and why it would work, rather than settling for conclusory assertions that things will all just magically fall into place. At the least, journalists will likely become more insistent that their questions be answered, and possibly, even, less critical of other journalists seeking the same.</p>
<p>There are, however, likely at least two ways in which the Trump Effect will be limited. First, it is far from clear that cable television news will begin its introspection before the dust of next November has settled. For one thing, there's a lot of money at stake - Comcast and Time Warner, as well as Fox, have made millions on higher ratings, literally profiting from proto-fascism in America, and there is no sign that Brian Roberts or Jeff Bewkes, not to mention Rupert Murdoch, feel the least bit squeamish about that. Les Moonves of CBS is even <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/10/cbs-chief-cheers-trump-go-donald-keep-getting-out-there/">cheering Trump on</a>. Perhaps the others are wringing their hands privately.</p>
<p>Next, the never-ending mantra of every press critic of campaign coverage, from time immemorial - that we need less on personalities and the horse race, and more of about the myriad of "issues" - is unlikely to be stilled, or to be satisfied. For too many voters, as every editor in her or his darkest heart knows, reading about most "issues" feels too much like eating their broccoli. And presidential voters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQmTeVf2nJ8">just like presidents themselves</a>, simply can't be made to do it.</p>

<p>In a year that saw Snapchat launch Discover, Twitter launch Periscope, and Apple launch Apple News, it might seem odd to suggest that next year news will slow down. Yet there has been a growing narrative of information overload as the number of sources for news have expanded exponentially. </p>
<p>News organizations have spent the last few years working on their liveblogging technology and push notification strategies, figuring out how they deliver the news faster than their rivals. 2016 is the year we'll take a new approach. </p>
<p>We've always been curators of news - sifting through information, sorting fact from opinion, verifying data and explaining issues to readers. This service is needed now more than ever. Publishers who help their readers understand the world - without constantly pushing new information because it’s new, not better - will be more highly valued. </p>
<p>Apple has already announced it plans to add human curation to its News app to highlight top stories. Twitter also launched Moments and has been testing a "what you missed" feature. These changes are a recognition that simply serving stories up to readers is no longer enough, and that, perhaps, is where the biggest opportunity lies. We’ve been curating the news for almost 200 years - the technology has changed, the fundamental needs of our readers have not.</p>

<p>Maybe 2016 is the year we realize that what we've been describing as a great transition is actually the destination. The train stops here, in an unsettled landscape of layoffs and startups, disruption and experimentation, aggregation and disaggregation, clickbait masquerading as news and news dressed up as clickbait. We should resign ourselves to decades of instability, which in these days of diminishing attention spans is pretty close to a permanent condition. MediaWorld is, and will continue to be, a place characterized by a fragmenting and reclustering of audience, the blurring of the line between reporting (too much work!) and asserting (look what it did for Donald Trump!), and, not least, the quest for a dependable business model - the digital oligarch, the mission-driven nonprofit, the algorithmic popularity contest, or maybe some variation on FanDuel.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive, news nerds. Think about your morning and evening journeys across the web. Not as an industry insider, but as a human. Where you can read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/12/05/after-a-mass-shooting-a-survivors-life/">big sweeping pieces of journalism about the victims of gun violence</a>, find incredible context on the complicated situation in Syria, learn about the <a href="https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/669545836746010625">history of the Thanksgiving holiday</a> on Snapchat Discover, catch up on great reporting from the front lines of the election, see that <a href="https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/672234341800521728">New York Daily News cover</a> everyone is talking about, flip through a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/667889939405791232?lang=en">Twitter Moment about owls with hats</a>, catch some industry buzz that you can bring to the office the next day, have <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/st-lenox-the-greyhound-bus-song-premiere">work-listening music recommendations</a> pushed to your phone through Facebook Notify, travel through time to read days-old recaps of that TV show you <em>just</em> got caught up on via DVR, and say "that's so me!" about No. 8 in a recent BuzzFeed listicle.</p>
<p>We're all citizens of world these days, crossing the borders of brands, platforms, and products to satisfy our unique and varied interests as the distinct little snowflakes that we are. But as publishers, when we think about engagement, we tend to think about it in the discrete context of our own properties, instead of thinking about the wide, wonderful world our readers can escape into with their phones and what engagement with our brand means across all of them.</p>
<p>We must keep working to increase the number of those highly-engaged, visit-all-the-time, likely-to-subscribe readers/viewers/listeners/consumers. But 2016 is the year we should all start doing that in wildly different ways. </p>
<p>Instead of: <em>Click here. Go here! Tap to expand this article. Download our app. Recommendations from our partners. More from this sub-branded vertical. Can I interest anybody in a newsletter?</em></p>
<p>Let's test millions of techniques to consistently engage readers through the distributed platform landscape of Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News, and the like. Let's personalize those newsletter offers for readers based on their reading history, referrer, or time, and test send times to optimize engagement. Let's move away from the broadcast model for alerts, finding more segmented ways to use push beyond the breaking-news context. Let's use deep linking to light up those latent lovers of our brand who have our apps installed but use them rarely.</p>
<p>But most importantly, let's radically reinvent the article experience to encourage deeper reading, further browsing. How might we more naturally bring readers from one story to another? How might we recreate the serendipity readers create for themselves while jaunting through the web? How can we increase our page load times so readers never have to wait? How might we use the time-honored traditions of news design to create oases for news reading in this increasingly distracting world?</p>
<p>A guy we like a lot around here once said that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-quotes-2015-7">when you're in a tight box, you have to invent your way out</a>.

<div id="content_div-118866">
<p>One of the most disconcerting things about walking into a modern newsroom is seeing so many giant homepages on display. If we hung products up based on audience size and opportunity, the homepage would drop immensely in priority. My prediction for 2016 is that distributed platforms and native environments will be more valuable than the traditional homepage. </p>
<p>Admittedly, social and mobile have long been more valuable than the homepage in terms of getting scale to content. But in terms of monetization - and in terms of publisher obsession - it's a little more tricky. Social has traditionally referred traffic back to sites, where publishers rushed to figure out how to engage that traffic once it came in. Long story short: It's proven difficult. </p>
<p>Homepage audiences are generally more engaged. Hence some of the reason for the focus, even as those audiences have diminished dramatically. But in the native landscape, there is a new hold out for hope. The audience experience is primarily off-site, meaning it's generally native to the platform. From a product perspective, that equals better engagement. </p>
<p>The distributed era is dawning. Apple News and Apple TV, Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, Twitter Moments, Snapchat Discover, 360º video and VR, over-the-top TV, chat apps - these are all products, platforms, and programs developed (<em>ish</em> - Google AMP is open source) by tech companies. What many of them have in common is that they're developed for publishers or used by them to engage new audiences. Each is its own animal, with its own business implications and audience growth potential, which in many cases is nascent; high cost to play (<a href="http://towcenter.org/new-report-virtual-reality-journalism/">VR</a>) with low user consumption (well, VR). But things are quickly changing. </p>
<p>O.G. native apps are also finally going to get their due (phone apps, tablet apps). In fact, I would argue, these native apps will be key. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/09/google-search-now-indexes-ios-9-apps-with-deep-links-safari-will-show-app-content-by-end-of-the-month/">Deep linking</a> will change this game in many ways. We're only starting to see the beginning of it. Publishers see their app users more than twice as engaged as their web users. And there's also long been the ability to monetize these apps through higher-prices CPMs or through subscriptions. These are premium users. </p>
<p>Homepage value is inflated. Of course it's valuable as an organizing principle and as a v.1 product for the web. It's valuable for direct audiences, and it's very valuable for big display advertising dollars. But it's not valuable as a precious obsession for publishers and brands. Because the more we focus on resourcing them, the less we focus on building out other experiences within native environments. </p>
<p>Publishers need a few things for this to be of real value: good analytics, monetization mechanisms, product development partners, and fresh ideas on how to create content that is native to the platforms. And let it be said that the business terms are not always favorable for publishers. That's <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bends-to-publishers-tweaks-instant-articles-advertising-1449676734">going to change</a>. Platforms and publishers enjoy a symbiotic relationship, even more so in the brave new world of deliberate news experiences on new surfaces. It takes a real cross-functional and digital-first organization to understanding how to approach each opportunity. Read into this if you haven't. It's your 2016 roadmap. And it's exciting!</p>

Luckie</h5><h6><a href='http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/adele-and-the-death-of-clickbait/'>Originally published on Nieman Lab</a></h6><div class="simple-body" style="font-family: freight-sans-pro, georgia, serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 30px; width: 100%; padding: 0 25px 25px 25px; margin: 0;">
<div id="content_div-118850">
<p>Journalism is dying. It's dead. Call the cryptkeeper because it's buried six feet under.</p>
<p>You know what other industry is dying? Music. Nobody buys records anymore. Except they are. Adele and a few other artists have bucked this trend by releasing substantive music that is unmistakably theirs. But like an increasing segment of pop music, some journalism has been reduced to a pre-fab format of what we think will get web denizens to make that all-important <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>By now, you're familiar with clickbait: stories several paragraphs long that could easily be one sentence; headlines that pose questions that aren't answered in any meaningful way in the copy; uninspired lists of tweets culled by a social media producer eager to get an ounce of the zeitgeist traffic. 2015 saw a rise in the amount of clickbait scuttling its way through the web.</p>
<p>A hastily written article may net a few hundred or a few thousand clicks (if you're lucky) - maybe more if it gains traction. But digital natives have wised up: They're less likely to share after they read these articles because of their lack of heft. Newsrooms who employ this tactic immediately lose the trust of users, who don't return for more. </p>
<p>Just like clickbait articles, there are plenty of Adele knockoffs out there. You can hear "Rolling in the Deep" being belted out at any local karaoke bar. There are thousands of YouTube stars covering the singer's tracks, hoping for a sliver of the success she has enjoyed. </p>
<p>Adele's new album <em>25</em> has already sold more than 5 million copies, mostly because she set the expectation for her fans that good music was to come. It's her meaningful lyrics within the space of a four-minute song that capture our hearts. We can all see ourselves in Adele's vocalized breakups and triumphs.</p>
<p>People want content that they can connect to on an emotional level and that they know their friends will too. That's the secret to virality, as many newsrooms have uncovered this year.  </p>
<p>You may be asking yourself: <em>Well, Mark, isn't the headline of this article kind of clickbaity?</em> Yes, and knowingly so. Your article can be topped with a cool headline, but you'd better back it up with something substantive. (I'll leave it up to you to decide whether I've done that here.) Listicles and quizzes can also rightly earn a place alongside traditional reporting if they follow the aforementioned tenet.</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2012, we witnessed the majority of newsrooms taking to social media to publish their content and, to varying degrees, interact with users. One or two years later, we saw an expansion of this theme as newsrooms hired additional staffers to capitalize on a powerful conduit for traffic.</p>
<p>In 2015, the news industry saw a divergence in strategy. Some publishers steered their newly hired staffers and the existing cadre of reporters toward creating spot content. The faster it was published, the better. Context, in many cases was incidental. </p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we saw newsrooms make a push toward unique digital content. Some of the breakout stars of the past year - BuzzFeed Video and the lauded podcast Another Round, The New York Times' Justine Sacco piece and others like it, the work of The Washington Post's team of dedicated social media journalists, the contextual reporting on Vox, and a little podcast named Serial - all drew large audiences through social. In 2016, we'll see more of these ventures as newsrooms pursue original ideas and strategies.</p>
<p>Why be a first-week flop when you can be the celebrated talent this industry called you to be? Set your own standards of excellence instead of looking to others for inspiration. Be your own competition. In 2016, it's time to stop chasing pavements and instead set fire to the rain (see what I did there?). Will an immediate shift in focus make your stories go multi-platinum? Maybe not. But pushing tinfoil tweets isn't going to get you there either.</p>

<div id="content_div-118856">
<p>Creating succinct, engaging interactive graphics is a complex task on its own. Creating interactive graphics that work on mobile devices, with their ballooning variety of screen sizes and touch gestures, is a task that can make even the most dedicated developer break down and cry. (I maintained seven results apps for six markets during the 2014 election, AMA.) This task has gotten so complicated that a session at SRCCON 2015 <a href="https://github.com/julia67/data-viz-for-all">developed a repo of resources for producing mobile-aware interactives</a>. And, as an industry, our interactives are getting fancier (think <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/mars-gale-crater-vr/">VR</a> or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/17/health/wiredwell-food-diary-super-tracker.html?_r=0">scroll-based line charts</a>).</p>
<p>We’ve already started to realize that not everything needs to be interactive. In 2016, we’ll see the rise of static graphics as news organizations seek to create good mobile experiences. This is already happening to some extent. ProPublica has used slideshows to create the feel of interactive visualizations. In their “Unrestrained” piece, they use a slideshow to step through <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/advoserv-profit-and-abuse-at-homes-for-the-profoundly-disabled">how restraints are applied</a> to residents of group homes. This is an effective treatment because the images are thoughtfully constructed to work in series.</p>
<p>But it’s not just good-hearted concern for reader experiences that will drive static graphic use. It’s also a play for Google’s good favor. Google has said that, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/google-will-start-sending-search-traffic-to-fast-loading-amp-news-articles-in-february-2016/">beginning next February</a>, it will start directing traffic to pages using its <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> framework. AMP’s stated goal is a faster, open mobile experience, which it seeks to achieve partly by clamping down on the sorts of media and libraries that can be served. For instance, JavaScript libraries, responsible for powering the majority of interactive graphics, must be open-source for AMP to serve them. Only a few media types (images, videos, slideshows, and the like) are allowed, though the option to create custom elements exists. (More about what AMP might mean for interactive journalism can be found <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/what-amp-maybe-means-news-developers/">here.</a>)</p>
<p>As more publishers seek to take advantage of AMP and its share of mobile traffic, simpler graphics will be employed for speed and ease of implementation. </p>
<p>Such an approach can actually be more effective than an interactive graphic. The New York Times has done several stories <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/us/gun-sales-terrorism-obama-restrictions.html">interspersing static snapshots of data</a> throughout. This works especially well on devices, where a stray finger won’t accidentally engage a visualization while swiping down. In data- and script-heavy circumstances, serving static images instead of interactive graphics is also potentially less load on mobile data. And in this case, it also saves the reader from having to swipe back up several times just to reference the data.</p>
<p>The other benefit of this approach? Newsroom developers can focus more effort on in-depth, experimental technology - one of which just might become the basis for my 2017 prediction.</p>

<div id="content_div-118816">
<p>Much of the talk around the rise of platforms (Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News, Snapchat Discover, etc.) revolves around what many assume to be their lack of interest in local media. I don’t think that’s true - 2016 will be the year the platforms will scale down to local news partners.</p>
<p>The turn toward local will happen as we see groups of local media band together to work with the platforms. It strengthens their position to get more attention, and it provides the platforms with easier access to larger, aggregated audiences. It’ll be good business for the platforms and local media.</p>
<p>The platforms initially targeted the big, national partners for obvious reasons: They could negotiate with a few entities with large audiences as they fleshed out and tested their own model. The next logical step was to turn to national networks of local or niche properties. We saw Facebook sign up Hearst and Gannett this fall. And Facebook’s willingness to sign up digital startup Billy Penn is proof they’re willing to go even more local.</p>
<p>It’s clear local media organizations must go to the platforms to some degree to serve their audiences and meet people where they are. Creating partnerships with the social platforms is a tricky proposition for any media company because it means giving up more control of the distribution channel - but that cat’s already out of the bag.</p>
<p>It's also good business for the local partners. They can serve their communities better with the content they already create without much of the resource-intensive work required to compete with the infinite amount of players in the digital space. If the content is good, it’ll remain good regardless of the platform. And we can’t forget the media companies get paid - 100 percent of revenue from ads they sell and 70 percent of what the platform sells. Of course, this all assumes the platforms’ terms will remain favorable to their partners. I don’t see that changing as long as the platforms continue only to aggregate and not create the local content.</p>
<p>As a by-product, these deals will force media companies to think about how they’ll generate revenue in places other than their own site or publication. Local media will work together and the social platforms will turn to them for partnerships.</p>

<div id="content_div-118798">
<p>The industry has been talking a lot about audience engagement lately, but mostly via online tools (at times intersecting with civic tech) and in-person forums. But where have any these ideas connected to the current polarizing political discourse - including where young people have been on fire, trying to push for systems change and accountability?</p>
<p>In 2016, journalism is going to rethink on how we frame audience engagement in the following ways:</p>
<p>- <strong>Engaging means being brave and reaching out, instead of asking audiences to come to you. Build trust and relationships over time.</strong></p>
<p>It's very difficult to build trust and credibility online in ways that get people to know who you really are - especially when you're trying to reach new audiences. You have to go out there and show your value to these communities in a way that resonates instead of being presumptive about your value. Be transparent about your agenda; ask a lot of questions and listen thoughtfully. But make sure that as a content provider you are offering a win-win solution. It's the first step to building brand loyalty.</p>
<p>And on this, there's going to be an opportunity for news organizations to build a robust local strategy. When we're building audience relationships, a local strategy provides more immediacy, speaking to the issues most relevant to audiences.</p>
<p>- <strong>We're going to stop saying "underserved" audiences and look at new audiences as audiences of opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of lip service around building diverse audiences, but these audiences will not engage with (much less pay) for your content if they don't feel valued or included in your content.</p>
<p>- <strong>The new highly valued skill in authentically engaging new audiences will be the ability to connect and bridge diverse constituent groups.</strong></p>
<p>I've seen some of these emerging leaders in the next generation of journalists. They have this rare ability to go in and gain membership to many different constituent groups. In a highly segregated city like Chicago, it's especially valuable. These journalists bring different groups of people together, get community buy-in, and can attract audiences I don't typically see come out for these forums.</p>
<p>- <strong>There's a business case for doing the above three very well. It makes it clear the critical role journalism has to play in fostering a better civic discourse that takes (<em>all</em> of) its audiences seriously. Then we can have interesting and new civic conversations to move us as a society of disparate community groups collectively forward.</strong></p>
<p>I was a musician just as the digital music revolution hit, and we were stressed about kids not wanting to pay for music anymore. But my savvier colleagues revved up their game and created unique experiences for their audiences - some of them even switched to a donations-only model. And guess what? Their audiences supported these artists, some even more than before.</p>
<p>I also see it in public media. You have to treat your audiences well and give them "the feels" for issues and experiences outside their own worldview. Journalists are expert empathizers - audiences will come to value this rare skill and pay for it, even if they don't always agree with your content. The tote bag isn't enough for public media donors to continue to contribute year after year - it's the social value that public media brings to people who want smart and thoughtful information.</p>
<p>This year, journalists and news organizations will own their critical roles in the civic conversation. Folks are hungry for it - especially in the context of the 2016 elections. The time is now, and 2016 will be a huge opportunity year for this.</p>

<div id="content_div-118778">
<p>Back in 2014, Fox News discovered that Cosmo had begun to cover politics and news in depth, with the women's magazine openly and proudly endorsing policies that benefited women's health. Baffled by this, Fox News' <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a30994/fox-news-host-women-dont-want-to-read-about-politics-they-just-want-fashion-tips/">response was totally predictable</a>.</p>
<p>"Is this beyond the purview of what the readership of this magazine actually wants to see?" said panelist Guy Benson during a broadcast. "Do they want to be preached at about politics when they really just want to check out the latest fashions and these wonderful shoes you guys are all wearing?"</p>
<p>Though the station's actions were criticized, Benson’s line of thinking didn't appear out of nowhere. The content produced by women's and men's "lifestyle" brands have traditionally differed in a way that suggests exactly what Benson said: Women can't care about both news and lifestyle. But that doesn't line up with the truth. Women are actually reading the news, and not by accident. </p>
<p>Women have always been interested in the news and what's happening in the world. Heck, they even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/25/politics/btn-women-voters/">turn up to the voting polls</a> more than men. According to a Pew Research study, women and men consume news differently - women tend to watch their news and men read it - but on the whole, the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/2008/02/06/where-men-and-women-differ-in-following-the-news/">share of men and women who said they followed news stories</a> only differed by a margin of 5 percent. But up until recently, women-centric outlets, aside from the <a href="http://jezebel.com/">Jezebels</a> and <a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/">Everyday Feminisms</a> of the web, haven't delved too deep into presenting women with equal yet different types of content. </p>
<p>When I asked my own Facebook friends, who come from a variety of races, backgrounds, and education levels, if they felt like they could go to a traditional women's outlet for substantive news, the majority answered with a resounding "no." One commenter discussed the difference between men's and women's lifestyle sites: Both offer content that isn't newsy, but the men’s, in her opinion, are the ones that have sustained a decent reputation for reputable news and commentary.</p>
<p>"I don't get my news from women-centered websites," she wrote. "Might seem strange, but I actually LOVE Esquire and have always wished women had an equivalent news/media source that wasn't the pink-washed clickbait we see so often. Esquire is so phenomenal to me because it's funny, smart, well considered, written by phenomenal journalists and writers alike, covers contemporary news and asks what it means to be a man in today's age. News outlets geared towards women don't hit that simple, thoughtful mark that treats women as intelligent, even-keeled, considerate, well dressed citizens."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of things that aren't explicitly women's issues that would benefit from being covered by women reporters, and whose coverage could avoid a lot of tired tropes by being handled by a journalistically responsible feminist writer," wrote another.</p>
<p>Here's the good news: Women's media is starting to catch up. Within the last few years, The Huffington Post launched HuffPost Women and Hearst created a digital team that most notably revamped Cosmo.com, now a staple on Snapchat Discover alongside Vice and CNN. Refinery29 is close behind, a traditionally fashion brand that touts successful news roundups every morning and investigative pieces on rape culture in high schools. (That one I wrote - <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/07/89757/north-penn-nudes-dropbox-scandal">if you'd like to check it out</a>.) Even newsletters like <a href="http://www.theskimm.com/">The Skimm</a> and Lena Dunham's <a href="http://www.lennyletter.com/">Lenny Letter</a> are gaining momentum talking about social issues and current events, whether or not they're related to women specifically. They talk about the latest bombings overseas and what the GOP candidates really stand for, as well as body image and race. These are issues that women, as human beings, care about and now don't have to click out of their favorite gender-focused site to find. </p>
<p>While there is plenty of space taken up by women publishers already, there are still seats at the table to be filled by women publishers tackling news content. It's this reason that I accepted my job as editorial director of news and identity at Revelist, CafeMedia's new millennial women's site. When their people reached out to me about the job, I was excited. But it wasn't until they told me their vision, to add more smart news and analysis to a women-oriented platform, that I became invested. To not only create mainstream news content on a gender-specific platform, but be able to put those articles next to stories about the Kardashians and lipstick and making sure they all have equal credence.</p>
<p>It's already happening. But in 2016, it'll go from something that's happening to something that just <em>happens</em>. And if women readers want to rock wonderful shoes while reading it, so be it.</p>

<div id="content_div-118794">
<p>Journalism ended 2014 with a dark cloud hanging over the industry's head (i.e. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-what-went-wrong-20150405">Rolling Stone's campus rape report</a>), and here we are ending 2015 the very same way. The biggest challenge the news industry faces in 2016 is the continued erosion of credibility and trust with users, especially <a href="http://www.speakerboxpr.com/millennials-dont-trust-that-their-news-is-accurate/">millennials</a> and <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/09/17/uslatinos-and-blacks-dont-trust-how-mainstream-media-portray-them-study-finds/">diverse audiences</a>, the very growing market segments news organizations need to engage in order to survive. </p>
<p>From CNN's description of Baltimore's Freddie Gray as <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/cnn-describes-freddie-gray-as-son-of-an-illiterate-heroin-addict-twitter-goes-nuts/">the son of an "illiterate heroin addict,"</a> to the snail-like, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/12/09/neutral-journalism-model-is-straining-under-pressure-from-donald-trump-tense-times/">often schizophrenic way in which journalists respond to political figures</a> like Donald Trump, ethical standards appear to be so fluid these days that journalists don't seem to know what the standards are. So how can we expect audiences to understand? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/">The (Charleston) Post and Courier</a>, which was <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2015/04/10/charleston-post-and-courier-praised/">celebrated far and wide by other journalists</a> for its coverage of the police shooting death of Walter Scott <a href="http://alldigitocracy.org/when-cops-control-the-narrative/">initially</a> only reported the one-sided narrative by the police officer now charged with murder. It wasn't until a citizen's cellphone footage of that shooting surfaced that the public got to learn what really happened (footage that was sent to The New York Times, not the hometown newspaper). It was easy for The Post and Courier to get the coverage right, after the fact.</p>
<p>Just this month, audiences got to see journalists storm into the apartment of a couple accused of killing 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. To make matters worse, some aired the couple's prayer rug (no relevance whatsoever, as many Muslims have prayer rugs in their homes) and broadcast private details about the suspects, including baby pictures, Social Security numbers, and addresses. </p>
<p>One of the primary tenets of journalistic ethical codes is to do no harm, but the reckless reporting in these examples did exactly that. In San Bernardino, journalists' actions invited vigilantism, illustrated the media's tendency to dehumanize Muslims and other people of color, and completely ignored the safety and rights of neighbors and family members. In Charleston, only reporting the police narrative shows how journalists perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to the spread of erroneous information.</p>
<p>It's yet another reason why <a href="http://mumbrella.com.au/journalists-less-trusted-laywers-taxi-drivers-airport-baggage-handlers-reveals-readers-digest-survey-232982">journalists are now trusted less than lawyers and car salesmen</a>. </p>
<p>Starting in 2016, U.S. journalists can specifically start fixing this problem by changing the way they cover crime. No longer should reporters and editors take police narratives as the gospel truth, or the only side of a story that should get reported. Journalists should not only be more skeptical of people in authority, but also better manage their beats - and their time - so that they can cultivate sources in the community outside the halls of power. </p>
<p>More broadly, if journalistic ethics continue to slip, news organizations can write off ever engaging with growing audiences. It doesn't matter how much content they post on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter - if users don't trust journalists, they won't buy what news outlets are selling. Journalists must also do a better job holding one another accountable, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/11/22/glenn-greenwald-media-is-guilty-of-fear-mongering.cnn">the way The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald recently did on CNN</a>. Finally, journalists in 2016 must figure out who they want to be, and who they want to serve. If journalists' jobs are to appeal to the most prurient elements in society, then fine - own that and stop pretending to be neutral arbiters of the truth. But if journalists' jobs are to provide measured, thoughtful information and to engage with increasingly diverse audiences, then this is the year they must rethink their ethical standing.</p>

<div id="content_div-118701">
<p>2016 will be the year that news organizations realize that messaging and chat apps are not just another channel to leverage, but are representative of a significant change in what "social media" is. This is a change that will create dramatic challenges to the distribution strategies and business models that have been built upon an understanding of social media that no longer holds. This may be a year where we learn that, once again, the sands of the Internet have shifted beneath our feet.</p>
<p>By now, everyone is at least peripherally aware of the recent rise of messaging apps, most notably Snapchat, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, and Slack (more on what ties these all together in a moment). Thus far, they've been treated as peripheral to the core social media strategies for news organizations, which are largely built around Facebook and Twitter. The assumption is that these platforms (or ones like them) will remain dominant - that we can depend on the News Feed to endure.</p>
<p>But what if that's incorrect? What if the "social stream" typified by Facebook and Twitter is actually in decline as a primary mode of engagement and discovery, like the newspaper or the homepage before it? Inklings of Twitter's decline are starting to permeate public conversation, especially with the revelation that the platform <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/twitter-stock-drops-quarterly-results">has failed to sign up any new users in the U.S. in 2015</a>. But those of us in the media may be the least able to see Twitter's fall, as the service's affordance for broadcasting to large audiences appeals greatly to the needs and sensibilities of journalists.</p>
<p>While discussions of Twitter's struggles may have started to emerge, the Facebook News Feed is still assumed to be the dependable monolith in the world of social media. But what do we see when we actually look at what Facebook has been doing over the past year? Their most visible efforts seem to be dedicated to building out features in Messenger, like <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/introducing-messenger-platform-and-businesses-on-messenger/">hooks for other applications to build services into the chat layer</a>, as well as the (still in closed beta) personal assistant <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-personal-assistant-that-will-help-facebook-eat-the-inter#.huR2Bkg9d">Facebook M</a>. The other recent Facebook initiative is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/11/9714340/facebook-notify-news-app">Notify</a>, yet another service that sits apart from the main Facebook app and focuses on notifications and alerting. All the while, the News Feed hasn't seen much in the way of development, other than an increasing focus on video. The company itself has stated that Facebook <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9340319/facebook-mostly-video-soon-ted-zagat">will eventually be mostly video and VR</a>, evolving to become something <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/facebook-will-stop-at-nothing-to-be-more-like-youtube/">more like a competitor for YouTube</a> or other video platforms.</p>
<p>Taking all of these signals together, it seems more than likely that the News Feed as we currently know it will cease to exist, or at least cease to have the relevance it has now, before very long.</p>
<p>The decline of social platforms on which news organizations have built business strategies, combined with an ascendence of more chat-like platforms, promises to be a significant change. What we're seeing is a movement away from public or semi-public social platforms to platforms that are much more closed and private. There seems to be a desire, especially amongst younger cohorts, to communicate in much more carefully protected and curated social spaces.</p>
<p>These new entrants create a whole host of new questions, challenges, and (hopefully) opportunities for news and journalism. The apps mentioned above - Snapchat, WeChat, Slack, and Messenger - are by no means interchangeable. They differ in contexts, communities, media types, and more. But what they have in common is that they're all based on a one-to-one or one-to-few communication paradigm - a paradigm that feels much less native to publishing than the one-to-many contexts of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the like. These platforms privilege conversation over broadcasting, communication over publishing. What does journalism look like in a conversational space? What do we offer as news publishers that might feel native to these kinds of environments?</p>
<p>Looking forward, there are likely to be two outcomes. As more public, broadcast-oriented platforms decline, messaging platforms may expand to fill the need for content sharing and discovery, either by adding new feature sets or by adapting to behaviors that emerge from both users and publishers. In this case, journalism could evolve to take advantage of the affordances of the new spaces readers inhabit, becoming more conversational and de-emphasizing static articles and documents. This of course brings up many questions about business models, authorship, accountability, archives, and more.</p>
<p>Alternately, these messaging spaces may not be a fertile environment for news and content discovery at all. The role of journalism in fostering civic awareness and public dialogue may be inherently at odds with the more private nature of interaction on these platforms. In this case, there will be a needs gap: an opportunity for new kinds of platforms to emerge that are designed to create deep experiences around the publishing, curation, sharing, and discovery of content. If so, there will be an opportunity to develop environments that are created to explicitly support the needs of the news industry, perhaps even built by the news industry itself, with better discovery experiences for readers and better monetization mechanisms for publishers.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, however, it's likely that the strategies, editorial sensibilities, and analytics that have been developed for the current social media environment may very soon fail to bring new readers and build new relationships. The lesson the Internet teaches us again and again is that everything changes. The biggest mistake a publisher can make is to assume their current approach will hold, when in fact we all must constantly experiment and adapt to an ever-shifting landscape.</p>

<div id="content_div-118602">
<p>Journalists have always chased - and met - audiences where they are, from IRL community events to platforms like Facebook and Snapchat.</p>
<p>2016 will be the year we don’t just meet, but also talk to people on their phones. We’ll text with them. We’ll chat with them on chat apps.</p>
<p>Texting and chat platforms are the next frontier in social news. They’re an intimate space, a closed circle: We talk to our friends and our families there, we live so much of our virtual lives there.</p>
<p>As users begin to add journalists and news organizations to their contacts, our challenge is to adapt to a new medium of storytelling. Unlike old-school social, which is more about broadcasting, chat apps are much more personal - a space where conversations go in both directions.</p>
<p>The opportunity: Every single message is a push notification.</p>
<p>On platforms built for two-sided communication and conversations, the barrier for entry to engage with users is incredibly low. Users can send us tips; we can tell creative stories; we can build communities and engage with audiences.</p>
<p>The challenge: Every single message is a push notification, so every single message has to be worth it. </p>
<p>On platforms built for personal interactions, how do outlets remain authentic and effective? This is both an editorial and a technical challenge.</p>
<p>We will have to tackle questions like: Does the curiosity gap work in the same way in a message as it does on social? People are accustomed to exchanges on chat, so how do we have two-sided conversations with thousands or hundreds of thousands of users? Will the ping of a new message optimized for a user in Mumbai wake up a user in New York?</p>
<p>The truth is, challenges and opportunities of adapting to new platforms have always been similar. This is just the next frontier we’re going to tackle. Because chat isn’t just the future, it’s the present, too: We’re all already having conversations here. 2016 is the year journalists will join us. </p>

<div id="content_div-118744">
<p>As the always insightful <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/12/the-year-of-the-reader/">Cory Haik said last year</a>, 2015 was the year of the reader. Indeed it was: More people read the news on their phones, and more news organizations invested in mobile. <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/the-state-of-the-news-media-2015-newspapers-%E2%86%93-smartphones-%E2%86%91/">You saw the reports</a>: Major news organizations had more readers on their mobile sites over desktop. We followed readers where they were and where they will soon be. </p>
<p>As an industry, we've been given a gift: There's a whole new world on mobile to discover, so many new ways to experiment, and so many opportunities to reach our audience in far-flung parts of the world. So, what next?</p>
<p>2016 will be the year of the story. </p>
<p><strong>Next year, the story will decide the platform</strong>. More and more, news outlets will reach outside their comfort zones to experiment with innovative ways of storytelling. Maybe that story you’re writing or editing is better as a video or a Snapchat or told through Instagram photos. When you’re first discussing a story with your team, think initially about how to tell it. Find the best platform, and embrace it.</p>
<p><strong>Experimentation doesn’t have to be a huge lift.</strong> Not everything must be, nor should be, a 5,000-word story or an ambitious, customized experience. (But use those devices when they are warranted!) When you do stick with a traditional platform, though, find a low-commitment way to elevate your story. So many third-party tools exist that make experimenting easy, like Genius for annotation or <a href="https://soundcite.knightlab.com/">Soundcite</a> to add audio to stories. </p>
<p><strong>Don’t stick to one platform to tell your story.</strong> Yes, we understand the importance of social media, but what we don’t need to do is create one experience for one app. Take a story idea you have and try to find two or three ways you would present it on different platforms. That explainer about why an election in Nigeria matters can also be a Snapchat Story. A narrative about children living in a refugee camp <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/16/the-faces-of-syrian-children-who-only-know-life-in-a-refugee-camp/">can also be shown through Instagram</a>. At The Washington Post, we took Kevin Sullivan’s powerful series on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/life-in-the-islamic-state/2015/10/01/overview/">life under the Islamic State</a> and presented it through <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/651212613393776640?lang=en">Twitter moments</a>. We've already mastered the art of aggregation using tweets and other embeddable content - now let’s push our own stories to different mediums. </p>
<p><strong>It’s all about collaboration.</strong> More and more, newsrooms will move to integrate different departments and create an environment where developers, reporters, designers, video, and photo are working in the same space.</p>
<p><strong>Let go of your desire to add every tool to your big enterprise package.</strong> Try cool new things with a story when it makes sense. But not every presentation needs an interactive graphic and 360º video and a virtual reality component. Maybe it has one of those, or maybe even two. Maybe it has annotation, or it translates to different languages. Do what suits the story, but don’t overdo it.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> Keep innovating, keep trying, keep experimenting. But you don’t have to do it all at once, you don’t have to do it every time, and you don’t have to do it alone. Carefully consider what works for each story, and keep the reader in mind. We have an opportunity to reach new audiences in a way that we never have, but if we aren’t smart about matching the right tools with the right stories, we won’t reach that big audience - or, more importantly, bring them back.</p>

<div id="content_div-118543">
<p>Responsive design has made news websites look similar. Much more similar. In just a couple years, sites that once looked like distant cousins have turned into siblings. Larger fonts, more white space, and a seemingly limited number of layouts have all contributed to a general feeling of déjà vu. And when a news site unveils its responsive redesign, we can’t help but wonder if we’ve seen it somewhere before. I mean, we have, right?</p>
<p>Those of us in media try really hard to visually differentiate our sites from the others. But in the context of mobile, all those little differences are literally <em>little</em>. We vastly overestimate how well our audience recognizes our brand based from aesthetics alone. It’s asking a lot of design to be the sole force orienting the reader to the brand space, especially on small screens. At low contrast. In full sunshine. While the reader waits for the crosswalk sign to change, and is distracted by that taco truck across the street.</p>
<p>Design will increasingly be defined in terms of what it <em>does</em> rather than what it looks like. Usability and utility will force aesthetics to stand back, to get out of the way. Style decisions that news designers, editors, and stakeholders have traditionally pored over will become moot. Imagine the time you can devote to user experience when you choose not to debate which shade of grey speaks to your brand voice! (The answer is neither shade of gray. See above: small screen, low contrast, full sunshine.)</p>
<p>News organizations will become more willing to experiment with design in public, stripping ornament from tools to make them more usable. Features will evolve from shiny objects into plain Jane problem-solvers. Thoughtful testing will reveal how audiences want to use our sites. We’ll openly adapt, based from what users actually do instead of what we’d like them to do. And will the audience notice if a designer changes the font? Only if it hurts the reading experience. Only if it hinders comprehension. Only if it harms the shared experience of staying informed.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to tell a story now - a tweet, an infographic, a Snapchat Story, an Instagram post, virtual reality, a push alert. You’ve heard the buzzwords around these platforms: ~native~ and ~distributed~. They’re trends that took off in 2015. In 2016, let’s aim for a new trend: integration. Which does not refer to content - it refers to your newsroom. </p>
<p>Yes, news organizations are <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9013911/is-the-media-becoming-a-wire-service">publishing on more platforms than ever</a>. And we know that they're <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/03/a-wave-of-distributed-content-is-coming-will-publishers-sink-or-swim/">making content especially for those platforms</a>. But we still let two forms of journalism dominate how we tell stories: You’re a broadcaster or a writer. You reach for your camera or your notebook, so you can produce a video package or an article. Everything else is secondary. No matter the story, the default response is to fit it into the format you were trained in.</p>
<p>When you stop to think about <a href="http://nytlabs.com/blog/2015/10/20/particles/">how these formats came to be</a>, it seems kind of silly that we’re still hanging onto them. Pockets of our industry are going hard at truly native and distributed content, but most of us are still in the phase where it’s an afterthought. We’re defaulting to one type of format - one from a different era, intended for a medium that is not the Internet - then breaking it up and distributing it elsewhere. And that work is usually done by someone else (&#x1f44b;from a social media editor turned mobile editor - I would know). </p>
<p>News consumers are getting their information so many different ways, and you’re the expert on your story; you can probably tell it best. Other types of storytelling shouldn’t be just something that comes before or after ~The Thing~ you were trained to do. Sometimes they should be The Only Thing.</p>
<p>Newsrooms needed social media and mobile editors, but it’s time to move past the part where reporters do one chunk of work and leave the rest to the various experts. That expertise shouldn’t be hoarded by one desk. These skills need to be better integrated throughout newsrooms.</p>
<p>When you’re working on a story, ask yourself: How is your audience getting the news and how can you best serve them there? Learn about all the ways you can distribute content. Then always keep that diverse set of tools in mind. </p>
<p>We still need great articles and TV news packages, don’t get me wrong. But think story first. Let the material drive your story - don’t gather it and spit it out according to a formula. Don’t write 800 words when only 300 and an Instagram embed are necessary.</p>
<p>I don’t know what all your stories can or should look like. But I do know if we all move away from our default positions, we can surprise ourselves with our creativity.</p>
<p>(If you’re wondering if I thought about various ways to tell this story: I did. And I determined this is the best one. Maybe I’m more old-fashioned than you think.)</p>
